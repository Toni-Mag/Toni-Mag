            <h1>Welcome to PainFree Living</h1>
            <p>
                In our fast-paced lives, it's easy to neglect the simple yet essential comforts our bodies need. We often take our health for granted, assuming we’ll always be strong and pain-free, until the moment comes when we’re confronted with the reality of health challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
