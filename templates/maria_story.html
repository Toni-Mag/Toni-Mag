    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Maria's problems began with an intense fitness routine. Without adequate warm-ups, her enthusiasm turned into pain that gradually worsened. Simple activities like sitting or standing became unbearable. 
        She developed herniated discs, sciatica, and frozen shoulder, leading to chronic pain in her lower back, neck, and limbs. Sleep and work became impossible, and the lack of movement caused weight gain during her recovery.

    <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>
        After months of suffering, Maria discovered ergonomic tools and therapy products. Her journey began with a few essential items:
    </p>
    <ul class="tool-list">
        <li><strong>Ergonomic Lumbar Cushion:</strong> Provided much-needed support while sitting, relieving pressure on her lower back.</li>
        <li><strong>Twist Disk:</strong> Allowed her to start gentle core exercises, regaining strength and flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Knee Pillow:</strong> Improved her sleep posture, reducing strain on her spine and hips.</li>
        <li><strong>Portable Massage Tool:</strong> Helped her manage muscle tension and pain during recovery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Alongside these tools, Maria introduced regular stretching routines and low-impact exercises like yoga and pilates. These small but consistent efforts brought a gradual yet significant improvement in her mobility and well-being.
